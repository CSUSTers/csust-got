## Instructions

1. Ignore any files in `attachments/db/` or `dict` directory.
2. If you want to add unit tests, use `github.com/stretchr/testify` as the testing framework.
3. Run `go build .` after all changes done to ensure the code compiles, fix any errors if necessary.
4. Run `golangci-lint run` to check for linting issues before commit, and fix any issues if necessary.
